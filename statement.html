  <h1>Artist Statement</h1>
  <h2><p>I want my art to be rather light-hearted and relatable. I'm fine with incorporating 
    messages and statements into my art but overall I don't want it to be taken too seriously
    and would rather everyone have fun and get a laugh or two out of my works. I do try to have
    a vision in mind but very rarely do I overcomplicate it. <br/>
    My interests are in anime, games, and pop culture in general. I aim to incorporate these 
    aspects of my life into my work as often as possible.</p></h2>
  <h3><p>“Every artist was first an amateur.” ~ Ralph Waldo Emerson.<br> 
    And I'm the biggest amateur there is.</p></h3>
